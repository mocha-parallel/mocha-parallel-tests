## 2.0.0

v2 is a completely new version of `mocha-parallel-tests` rewritten in TypeScript from scratch. Its main focus is to simplify parallel run of mocha tests: while previously they were executed in one single process **now each file is executed in a separate process**.

Some of the main changes are:

 * **breaking change**: each file is now executed in a separate process
 * **breaking change**: minimum supported node version is 8 because it's current LTS and because of [performance reasons](https://blog.risingstack.com/important-features-fixes-node-js-version-8/)
 * **breaking change**: main exported file should now be imported as `require("mocha-parallel-tests").default` if you're using CommonJS modules
 * **breaking change**: `--retry` is not supported anymore: `mocha-parallel-tests` main target is to be 100%-compliant with `mocha` in terms of API and to not introduce its own options and APIs other than `--max-parallel`
 * **breaking change**: reporter output/stats now contains one more level for each file
 * change: `--max-parallel` option is `os.cpus().length` by default. You can also specify it manually or set it to 0 which means "immediately launch as many processes as the number of files"
 * new: `--delay` option is now supported for each subprocess
 * new: `--retries` option is now supported for each subprocess
 * new: supported peerDependencies versions of `mocha` are not 3, 4 and 5
 * new: all tests are now executed against all supported mocha versions
 * new: `mocha-parallel-tests` install should work fine on windows
 * new: TypeScript definitions are now provided in package.json

 * fix: support `reporter.done()` callback for all external reporters (`mochawesome` for example) in both CLI and node.js API ([#113](https://github.com/mocha-parallel/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/113))

## 1.2.8

 * fix: do not fail if no target is set and `--recursive` option is used ([#94](https://github.com/mocha-parallel/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/94))

## 1.2.7

 * fix: add support for `xdescribe`, `xcontext`, `xspecify`, `xit` and `it.skip` ([#102](https://github.com/mocha-parallel/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/102))

## 1.2.6

 * fix: tests with binary dependencies can now be used with `mocha-parallel-tests` ([#100](https://github.com/mocha-parallel/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/100))

## 1.2.5

 * fix: if file contains multiple `describe()` sections in it, one of it fails and `mocha-parallel-tests` is executed with `--retry` option, only this failed section is re-executed ([#77](https://github.com/mocha-parallel/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/77))

## 1.2.4

 * fix: `--no-exit` CLI option is supported ([#85](https://github.com/mocha-parallel/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/85))

## 1.2.0

 * **new**: using mocha-parallel-tests programmatically is now supported. You can also pass own mocha-parallel-tests options by calling `setOwnOptions({maxParallel, retry})` method of mocha-parallel-tests instance. You should call it before `run()`.

## 1.1.x

 * **breaking change**: `mocha` is now in peerDependencies part of `mocha-parallel-tests` which means that you need to add both `mocha` and `mocha-parallel-tests` in your project's package.json.

## 0.4.x

 * **new**: support for mocha `--compilers` option introduced
 * fix: tests using `--max-parallel=1` run without errors ([#34](https://github.com/mocha-parallel/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/34))

 * fix: exit codes are now the same as in original mocha runner ([#27](https://github.com/mocha-parallel/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/27))
 * bump `mocha` version to 2.4.5. Check its [changelog](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more info. Previous version was 2.3.4.

## 0.2.x

 * **new**: `--retry <num>` to set number of retries for failing tests (0 by default)

## 0.1.x

 * fix: `console.log|error`s from tests do not cross with each other. Instead they are waiting until proper test starts executing :smiley:
 * fix: support stack trace of errors
 * fix: support for incoming array of files
